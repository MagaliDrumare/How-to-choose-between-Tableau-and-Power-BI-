-Desktop and web/mobile cost for Power BI is lower.  
-The server solution of Power BI is not free : 5K vs 8K for Tableau. 
-For every $1 invested in BI Software, $2 to $35 in labor over 3 years. 
-Poorly selected BI software is a major culprit of the hight total cost ownership. 

Management Issue : 
* -> What's matter is the right software for the right needs?

-Power BI can only show 10K data points. 
-Power BI sampling above 10K data points can make important trends go unnoticed.

-Organizations have to be able to deal with the frequent updates of Power BI cloud solution.

https://youtu.be/kbeGIKu0Jxo
 
-Tableau adquire CleanGraph in 2017 (only a demo). 
-Power BI Q&A is already available (7 years ago and amazing). https://youtu.be/qMf7OLJfCz8

Management Issue : 
* -> Natural language is a not yet a mature topic. 
* -> Need to start with really simple and small data models.
* -> The user need to ask the right question. 
* ->The users need to learn how to use the functionnality.

https://youtu.be/SmpYzRQhtUg

-If your team works with reports with thousands of data points, Power BI might run into limitations when viewing and exporting data. (scroll problems to be solve by Microsoft)

https://youtu.be/kuYQifjdolM
https://youtu.be/6Kg3jfb2WmY
* two surveys made by Tableau and DataSelf BI

- Tableau survey on 3-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
Tableau : $20.9M vs Power BI $26.9M. 

Management Issue : 
* -> Check the needs on BI. 
* -> Don't choose the software based on the Licence Cost.  
* -> Long term investment mainly Labor investment. 


## Power BI vs Tableau Final recommandation : 

Management Issue : 
* -> Data visualization is the prime focus of the analytics that your business seeks to run. If this is the case, Tableau is the right choice. 
* -> But if your business is looking for a platform that would provide broad analytic capabilities in terms of predictive modelling, optimization, and reporting, the Power BI suite would be a much better choice.
